# Tumblr2Shaarli

This project is just about saving your tumblr into a shaarli instance (new or used)

## Why?

Because I don't use Tumblr anymore, but used it a lot to bookmark and wanted to save it, self-hosted style.

I don't want to be dependant of an app anymore.

And Tumblr's API is easy to use, so, why not?

## How?
